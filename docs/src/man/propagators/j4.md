The J4 analytical orbit propagator considers the perturbation caused by the terms ``J_2``,
``J_2^2``, and ``J_4``. It is a slightly more precise version of the J2 analytical orbit
propagator useful for mission design and analysis.

## Algorithm

The algorithm implemented here is based on **[1, 2]**. This version takes into account only
the secular effects in the orbit elements.

Considering only the terms ``J_2``, ``J_2^2``, and ``J_4``, we obtain that only the right
accession of the ascending node (RAAN), the argument of perigee, and mean motion are
perturbed by the geopotential field with secular effects. However, we also include the
possibility of inputting the mean motion time derivatives to consider the impact like energy
dissipation by air drag.  The complete algorithm is available in **[1, pp. 647-654,
692-693]** where we assumed ``J_6 = 0``.
